DayLeaf memo launcher - Android widgets to create text files for daily memo

This application provides an easy way, as home screen widgets, to create,
edit, and send text files in a daily basis to create memo on everyday life.

Usage
-----
This application only provides widgets that work as short-cuts to
- start editing a text file and
- send the text file.

Long tap home screen to add the two widgets, `DayLeaf2 - Edit` and
`DayLeaf2 - Send`. NOTE: `DayLeaf2 - Edit` does not work now.

The short-cuts works well with a text editor and an appllication
that shares files among devices, like
[Dropbox](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dropbox.android).
